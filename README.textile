Demo project for the blog post: "Typesafe Stack 2.0":http://gadget.greenformatics.hu/typesafe-stack-20

I have used the "pi-calculator sample project":https://github.com/playframework/Play20/tree/master/samples/workinprogress/pi-calculator as a starting point and made several changes to follow a typical enterprise architecture that has:
* a web frontend for user interaction running in a web container
* multiple calculation engines/batch servers running in their dedicated jvm, communicating with the frontend by messages

To run the standalone calculator application:
gadget@devblog:~/workspaces/typesafe-stack-demo$ sbt
> project typesafe-stack-demo-calculator
> run

To run the frontend:
gadget@devblog:~/workspaces/typesafe-stack-demo$ sbt
> project typesafe-stack-demo-frontend
> run
